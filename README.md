# ProteaGeorge

We have created a mathematical model that predicts the impact on the population density of the Protea King flower, the national flower of South Africa, taking into account the spectral phenomena captured through spectroscopy at the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden located in Cape Town. Our goal is to understand how to reduce the climatological risks that will affect the population of the flower and its distribution over time in order to help preserve this species and the region's flora.
