# ProteaGeorge

We have created a mathematical model that predicts the impact on the population density of the Protea King flower, the national flower of South Africa, taking into account the spectral phenomena captured through spectroscopy at the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden located in Cape Town. Our goal is to understand how to reduce the climatological risks that will affect the population of the flower and its distribution over time in order to help preserve this species and the region's flora.

# Matematicla background
We used the Lotka-Volterra model to determine the population flow of the plant and identify a threat, in this case, it was the increase in temperature.

Through linear regression, we predicted a future trend using data collected from temperature spectroscopy in the study area, which was the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden.

For the time series, we employed the ARIMA model, which utilizes previous data to analyze the temperature's behavior in subsequent years and measure its impact on the plant.

# Biological background
A reduction in species distribution due to severe climate change could lead to a substantial loss of genetic connectivity. The more severe future climate scenarios are likely to cause even greater variability loss or a more distinct homogenization in the genetic variation of the species.

The rise in global temperatures facilitates the establishment of invasive species in ecosystems."

Climate change is impacting the distribution of species through changes in growth, reproduction, and mortality. Some species have already shifted their ranges in recent decades, most likely in response to climate changes.
